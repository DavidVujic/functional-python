# Functional Python
Experimenting with functional programming in Python.

How functional is Python?

Is functional programming even applicable with the idea of writing `Pythonic` code,
or the `Zen of Python`? These things have been on my mind lately,
since I have switched from `Clojure` to writing full time Python code.

In this repo, I share some ideas on how to find a possible way to be both __Pythonic__, and __Functional__.

The functional code examples are well suitable for super fast feedback loops during development,
by using a thing called `REPL Driven Development`.

I have tried keeping it Pythonic while adding functional patterns like `Railway Oriented Programming`,
and a really cool Python specific library called `toolz`.

I am using the source code here in my __Functional Python__ talk at [Python Web Conf 2022](https://2022.pythonwebconf.com/presentations/functional-python).
